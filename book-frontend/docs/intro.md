# Course Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive 13-week program will guide you through the essential concepts and practical implementations needed to develop autonomous humanoid robots.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to systems that understand and interact with the physical world using physics-based reasoning. Unlike pattern-matching algorithms, Physical AI systems incorporate knowledge of physical laws, dynamics, and real-world constraints to make intelligent decisions.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2 systems for humanoid robot control
- Create realistic simulations using Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim
- Implement advanced perception systems using NVIDIA Isaac tools
- Build Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for autonomous robot operation
- Deploy complete autonomous humanoid systems that respond to voice commands

## Prerequisites

This course assumes:

- Proficiency in Python programming (1-2 years experience)
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Comfort with command-line interfaces
- No prior robotics experience required (covered in Weeks 3-5)

## Technology Stack

Throughout this course, you'll work with industry-standard tools:

- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill**: Robot Operating System for communication and control
- **Gazebo**: Physics simulation and basic sensor modeling
- **Unity**: High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Voice processing for natural language commands

## Interactive Learning

This course features an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that provides immediate assistance based on the course content. Use the chatbot to clarify concepts, get code explanations, or explore related topics in more depth.
